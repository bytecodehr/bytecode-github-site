## Deploying your Shopify app on DigitalOcean can seem daunting, but with the right steps, it's a breeze. This guide will walk you through deploying your Shopify app using DigitalOcean's powerful cloud platform.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Shopify App
Before you begin, make sure your Shopify app includes a Dockerfile. This file is essential for DigitalOcean to understand how to deploy and run your app.
Dockerfile should like something like this
```
FROM node:18-alpine

ARG SHOPIFY_API_KEY
ENV SHOPIFY_API_KEY=$SHOPIFY_API_KEY
EXPOSE 8081
WORKDIR /app
COPY web .
RUN npm install
RUN cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
```

### Step 2: Creating Your DigitalOcean App
Create a new application on DigitalOcean and connect it to your Shopify app's GitHub repository. DigitalOcean automatically detects the Dockerfile and uses it for the deployment process.

### Step 3: Configuring Your Environment
You'll need to set four environment variables in your DigitalOcean app settings:
```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET
SCOPES
HOST (to be set after your server is up and running)
```
### Step 4: Deploying the App
Once your environment variables are set, deploy your app through DigitalOcean. The platform will build and run your app based on the Dockerfile.

### Step 5: Setting the HOST Environment Variable
After deployment, you'll be given a URL for your app. Update the HOST environment variable in your DigitalOcean app settings with this URL.

### Step 6: Finalizing Your Shopify Integration
At first, your app's URL will show "No shop provided". You'll need to point your Shopify store to this URL to install and integrate the app.

### Conclusion
Deploying your Shopify app on DigitalOcean simplifies the process, ensuring that your app is scalable and robust. Remember to regularly update and monitor your app for optimal performance.
