## How we kickoff projects
We start every project with a collaborative analysis of your industry, business, and the problem you need solved. We’re not trying to create rigid documentation, but rather to establish a shared understanding of your business goals, project requirements, and target audience. We want to make sure that working with us brings value to your business.
If we are a good cultural and professional fit, and both sides see value in working together — we can move forward.

# How we design and develop products
Our goal is to work in a way that minimizes that risk. In the early development stages, we focus on delivering a design concept or a working prototype.

Some benefits of this approach are:
  * You will have a working website in your hands after a relatively short amount of time
  * You can begin testing your initial assumptions by inviting a small number of early users
  * We will have a chance to quickly and effectively prove our competence, giving you peace of mind

# How we make sure that we’re moving in the right direction
Most projects fail because they never achieve product/market fit. People in charge of the project need to have a clear vision, but their assumptions can only be validated by actual results. That’s why we value releasing early and often, gathering user behavior data, and making changes accordingly.
