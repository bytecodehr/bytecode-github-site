  author_description: When I'm not a Product Designer, I can often be found cycling through picturesque landscapes, immersing myself in the joy of two-wheeled adventures. Reading books is another passion of mine, as I love delving into captivating stories and exploring new ideas. Beyond these pursuits, I relish engaging in various activities that nurture my creativity and keep me inspired.
