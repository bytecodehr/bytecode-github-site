<h2 id="how-we-kickoff-projects">How we kickoff projects</h2>
<p>We start every project with a collaborative analysis of your industry, business, and the problem you need solved. Weâ€™re not trying to create rigid documentation, but rather to establish a shared understanding of your business goals, project requirements, and target audience. We want to make sure that working with us brings value to your business.</p>

<h1 id="how-we-design-and-develop-products">How we design and develop products</h1>
<p>Our goal is to work in a way that minimizes that risk. In the early development stages, we focus on delivering a working prototype</p>

<p>Some benefits of this approach are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will have a working website in your hands after a relatively short amount of time</li>
  <li>You can begin testing your initial assumptions by inviting a small number of early users</li>
  <li>We will have a chance to quickly and effectively prove our competence, giving you peace of mind</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also building and maintaing mutliple wordpress websites for our EU clients.</p>
